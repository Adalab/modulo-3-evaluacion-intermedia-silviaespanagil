# React: Intermediate evaluation for Adalab
## _Pokedex_
¡Hola mundo!

After a week of diving in React waters here comes my intermediate evaluation ✨

## Initial Requirements 📋

- Create a react app
- The app must render Pokemon cards with an array content
- There must be an App, a PokeList and a Pokemon component

## Extra features 🔥
- Add some styles

## Built with 🔨
- Visual Code Studio: as code editor
- SASS
- React

## Development ⌨️
ho
For start I wrote down my PokeList component which feeds  itself from the JSON prop that is hosted in the App component. 

At PokeList I mapped the array so I could take the array objects and use them in the Pokemon.js component where I draw the cards using again props. You may notice that the Pokemon Type is an array inside my object so I had to map this also so I could render this information into the card.

For the extra features I just installed SASS and added some cute styles inspired in a Pokemon color palette.
